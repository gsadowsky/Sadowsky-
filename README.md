# hello-world
Initial github repository

I've been active in programming and networking for mor than 60 years, and now I'm exploring the newer environments of open source.  I have a particular interest in looking at economic policy simulation work going on with respect to both static and synamic simulations.  I worked in this rea from 1963 to 1975.
